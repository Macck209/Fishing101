# Fishing101
Adds 10 new fish types to the game.

- Some fishes are time-of-day-specific and others are biome-specific.
- Fish have different rarities and stats. 
- Most fish can be smoked. Note that they can only be smoked in smokers (not furnances), so new usage for smokers - yay!

Mod is serverside, but usage of a resource pack is strongly advised (/polymer generate-packs).
