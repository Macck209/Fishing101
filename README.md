# Fishing101
Adds 13 new aquatic life forms to the game (items, not entities).

- Some fishes are time-of-day-specific and others are biome-specific.
- Fish have different rarities and stats. 
- Most fish can be smoked. Note that they can only be smoked in smokers (not furnances), so new usage for smokers - yay!

Mod is serverside, but usage of a resource pack is strongly advised (/polymer generate-packs).
Huge thanks to Patbox and his [magical Polymer thingy](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer).
